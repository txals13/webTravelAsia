            <p>
                - <b>Best Time to Visit</b>: The best time to visit Laos is from November to February when the weather is cooler and drier. The wet season runs from May to October, which brings lush greenery but also occasional travel disruptions.
                <br>- <b>Currency</b>: The local currency is the Lao Kip (LAK). Cash is preferred in many areas, though major hotels and some restaurants accept credit cards.
                <br>- <b>Getting Around</b>: Laos is a landlocked country, so getting around is typically done via bus, minivan, or riverboat. Tuk-tuks are common for short distances in cities.
