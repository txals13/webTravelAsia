            <p>
                - <b>Best Time to Visit</b>: The Maldives is best visited during the dry season, from November to April. The monsoon season (May to October) can bring rain and wind but also offers fewer crowds and lower prices.
                <br>- <b>Currency</b>: The Maldivian Rufiyaa (MVR) is the official currency. However, US dollars are widely accepted in resorts and tourist areas, and major credit cards are also commonly used.
                <br>- <b>Getting Around</b>: Seaplanes, speedboats, and domestic flights are the primary modes of transportation between islands. For local island exploration, ferries and small boats are available.
